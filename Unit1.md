## The importance of data.

**Explain the impact of data in nowadays.**
* We can access to information from Internet, so we can know anything of way more digital and closer.
* In Sciencie and Medicine,  when collecting data about this fields, they permit to improve reatments and diagnoses.
* In education, there are training tools to customize the contents and adapt them to the abilities of each person.
* Social networks allow us to permanently connect to a worldwide network.

obteined data that we could not do by ourself before. For example, the ability to connect several devices and sensors to the
Internet, who generates a lot of new data at exponential speeds.

## Fundamentals of Big Data.

**Define the concept of Big Data.**

The basic concept responds to data that is varied enough, large and generated very quickly and from different sources, but it 
cannot be processed or managed by conventional methods easily, although there are tools. There are 10 characteristics, but the most 
prominent are the volume because they process large volumes of unstructured data. The speed that data is received and used. 
Finally, the variety refers to the various types of data available, usually unstructured.

**Differentiate between open data and private data.**
* Open Data are public and accessible for anyone, companies and organizations.
* Closed Data frequently restricts its use, through licenses or through privacy or security.

**Differentiate between structured and unstructured data.**
* **Structured data:** It is information that is usually found in most databases. They can be easily sorted and processed by all 
data mining tools.
* **Unstructured data:** They have an internal structure, but they are not structured through predefined data schemas or models.

**Differentiate between stored data and moving data.**
* The stored data are those that are structured and that are used for their analysis and for the generation of information.
* Moving data is data that is being transmitted on a network. In addition, they are stored in different sources.
