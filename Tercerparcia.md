### Describes the characteristics of a data center

* Security: The security and privacy of the data is essential. Access control measures are mandatory so that only authorized personnel can 
contact the data center. Protection tools such as data encryption must also be used, as well as security solutions against the loss of 
information.

* Storage capacity: Increasing amounts of data are being generated, but now companies can get storage units that have increasingly higher 
capacities or hire cloud services.

* Data transfer: When accessed they must be fast and effective, this refers to writing or reading. The network is essential here because 
it is generally used for access to information.

* Maintenance and prevention: You must have air conditioners to keep the place cool because the teams work 24/7. In addition, they must be 
equipped with specialized fire detection and protection systems for servers.

### Identify the characteristics of Cloud and Fog data analysis

* Cloud
  - They are in fixed monthly payments for use, without additional costs, since there is no need to invest in large infrastructure or 
licenses.
  - The data is always safe.
  - There is no need to have a large storage capacity.
  - Faster work when being based on the web.
  - Information in real time.
  - Strong investment in innovation.
  - Access to all information.
  - Access when you want and where you want, only with an Internet connection.

* Fog:
  - Proposes a solution to problems related to the implementation of the Internet of Things.
  - Reduces traffic between smart devices and cloud storage while saving costs.
  - Gives the user more visible control over the information that it generates.
  - Possibility of offline operation.
  
 ### Understand the concept of Data Engineering.

Use advanced programming as well as system building skills to create software solutions. The engineer understands not only how to build 
a data stream, but how to combine a variety of technologies and frameworks to create the best solution for the business.His tools of a 
data engineer can include systems like Oracle, Hadoop, MySQL, as well as languages. which include Java, Linux, SQL and JavaScript. They 
understand the operation or process of data analysis while the analyst is only responsible for analyzing the behavior of such data.
