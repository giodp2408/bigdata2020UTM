### Describes the characteristics of a data center

* Security: The security and privacy of the data is essential. Access control measures are mandatory so that only authorized personnel can 
contact the data center. Protection tools such as data encryption must also be used, as well as security solutions against the loss of 
information.

* Storage capacity: Increasing amounts of data are being generated, but now companies can get storage units that have increasingly higher 
capacities or hire cloud services.

* Data transfer: When accessed they must be fast and effective, this refers to writing or reading. The network is essential here because 
it is generally used for access to information.

* Maintenance and prevention: You must have air conditioners to keep the place cool because the teams work 24/7. In addition, they must be 
equipped with specialized fire detection and protection systems for servers.
